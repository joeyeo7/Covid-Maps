# COVID-19 Thematic Maps of the United States (2020)

## Project Introduction

This project visualizes COVID-19 impacts in the U.S. for the year 2020 through two thematic maps. The first is a choropleth map illustrating case rates per 1,000 residents across counties, and the second is a proportional symbols map indicating the total case counts by county. These visualizations aim to provide insights into the geographical distribution and intensity of the pandemic across the country.

## Primary Functions

- **Choropleth Map:** Utilizes a color gradient to depict COVID-19 case rates, highlighting the most affected areas.
- **Proportional Symbols Map:** Scales circle sizes to represent total COVID-19 cases, offering a clear visual comparison across counties.
- **Interactive Elements:** Both maps feature interactive components, allowing users to click on counties or symbols for detailed case and death information.

## Libraries in Use

- **Mapbox GL JS:** For creating and interacting with the map.
- **D3.js:** (If used) For data manipulation or adding complex visual elements.

## Data Sources

- COVID-19 case and death data: [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
